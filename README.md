## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Minahil**, a Machine Intelligence student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), passionate about building practical AI solutions.

Currently, Iâ€™m a **Software Engineering Intern** at [Magna Electronics](https://www.magna.com/company/company-information/magna-groups/magna-electronics), where I develop model inferencing pipelines for computer vision systems in self-driving cars.

My interests span a wide range of AI applications, from optimizing [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) models for real-time cone detection, to building virtual assistants for the elderly, and exploring robust NLP preprocessing techniques.

Outside of work and academics, I lead the **Electrical Subsystems** at [UofT Supermileage](https://www.utsm.ca), where we design and build ultra-efficient electric vehicles.
